Write a program to verify if the parking fee for a vehicle has been paid.
Paid parking is in force every day from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm.
A parking fee must be paid for at least 10 minutes. 
The maximum time you can pay for parking is 11 hours and 59 minutes, 
so you can, for example, pay for parking from 8.00 am to 7.59 pm on the same day or,
for example, from 7.00 pm to 6.59 pm the next day.

The program reads data from standard input. 
Lines with input data have one of the following two formats:

Introduction of information about payment:

<vehicle registration number> <start time of parking> <end time of parking>

Check if a fee has been paid:

<vehicle registration number> <current time>


The vehicle registration number consists of 3 to 11 characters being an uppercase letter
of the English alphabet or a number, where the first character must be a letter. 
Fields describing time consist of hours and minutes separated by a dot. 
The hour can be expressed with one or two digits (leading zero is optional). 
The minute is always expressed with two digits.

Correct time values start at 8.00 and end at 20.00. 
The values of the start time of parking and current time in subsequent 
lines of input data are weakly monotonically ordered.

Fields in the data line are separated by whitespace. 
At the beginning and end of the line, white characters may also appear.

The program confirms the introduction of information about the payment
by writing to the standard output the message:

OK L

The program confirms the payment by writing to the 
standard output the message:

YES L

The program confirms the non-payment by writing to the
standard output the message:

NO L

For the above messages, L denotes the line number. 
Lines are numbered from 1, including lines containing errors.

The program should remove from memory information that is no longer needed.

The program should end with code 0.
